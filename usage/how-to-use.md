# ðŸ–¥ How to use

Using this library is very simple! Just use the `Dictify` namespace in any piece of code you want to use the library, as in: `using Dictify;`

Just use the `DictionaryManager` class that contains:

* `GetWordInfo(string)`

You can then use the resulting array to iterate through possible words and get the values from them.
